# Ants-cpp

Ant Simulator because why not. Currently the only thing you can control is zooming in/out.

ants can currently create a trail and sample the area around them in a grid (to recreate smelling). Inspired by Pezzzas Works AntSimulator and Sebastian Lague :))

to run you will need SFML installed then you can:

```
cmake .
make
./antsagain
```
