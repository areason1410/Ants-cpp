# Ants-cpp

Ant simulation in c++ because i think it looks cool 

As is right now, i can run stupid high numbers of ants like 50k or 100k (granted at around rather low fps)

Original version was very unoptimised so i remade it using a grid so i didnt have to do so many loops :)

controls:

p: toggle ants moving
m: toggle marker rendering
a: toggle and rendering
g: show grid

by default ants wont move, press p to get em going :)
