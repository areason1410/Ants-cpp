# Ants-cpp

Ant Simulator because why not.

ants can currently create a trail and sample the area around them in a grid (to recreate smelling). Inspired by Pezzzas Works AntSimulator and Sebastian Lague :))

to run you will need SFML installed then you can:


Press T to toggle trail drawing, Scroll to zoom (not 100% finished)

Right now ants will follow the trail made by the to home, but this needs to be inverted so it tracks back.


```
cmake .
make
./antsagain
```
